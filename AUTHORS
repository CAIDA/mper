mper is based on the scamper source tree of 2009-06-04 with further ports
of code from later scamper releases.

mper is written and maintained by Young Hyun as a part of CAIDA's work
on the Archipelago Measurement Infrastructure
(http://www.caida.org/projects/ark/).

scamper is written and maintained by Matthew Luckie, member of the
WAND group in the Computer Science Department at the University of
Waikato (http://www.wand.net.nz/scamper).

Thanks to Alistair King for porting code from later scamper releases
into mper in Jun-Sep 2011.
